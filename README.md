Testing out working with this tool for software development and version control
I was a nurse for about 10 years, but now I'm into computer programming.  Having fun programming at my new job and on the side for fun.  I'm putting together a workstation for myself at home with a laptop and two monitors.  Should be more fun to work at than just my laptop.  Plan to build a book recommendation app.
